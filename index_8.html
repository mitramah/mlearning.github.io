             <h4>Research Question 1: How are the EFL students currently using mobile devices and mobile software to support language learning? 
            </h4>
            
             <p>
              The results based on the study, reveal that the students are currently using their mobile devices to perform a variety of educational tasks; approximately 96% of the students who participated in the survey. Inside the classroom, students are often performing supplementary activities, organizational tasks, and using their devices to access course materials and information via the Internet. The students use their mobile devices outside of the class to fulfill perform similar activities, for example, by downloading some language learning applications. Students also reported playing some type of educational game on their mobile devices.
             </p>
             
             <h4>
               Research Question 2: What are the social impacts of social networking websites; Web 2.0 in particular?
             </h4>
             
             <p>
              The question was among the open-ended questions, and most students agreed that social media sites, such as a Facebook community of language learners have positive effects on the learning process. One of the students stated that: “The language learning process can be easier through the use of social media. On the site a person can ask questions, talk to other members, meet with the members and practice the language together, post tasks all of that with no time and space limits because everything can be done online.” Another student believed that: “Social networking websites make communicating and exchanging thoughts/problems/questions much easier.” The students concluded that the social media websites could provide the opportunities for the group of learners who are constricted by their resources and are not able to receive updated material for their learning.
             </p>
             
             <h4>
               Researcher Question 3: How could the formal use of mobile devices inside and outside the classroom impact student learning, engagement, and participation?
             </h4>
             
             <p>
              The survey results reveal that the students' participation inside and outside of the classroom could increase by proper use of mobile devices. The results of the survey also indicate that the students would participate in class activities outside of the classroom if they could use their mobile devices. In addition, students would consider the use of mobile devices as an approach that allows them to spend more time on their classwork. The students would also prefer to see the integration of mobile devices in their classes, and they would ask for help if they could communicate through their mobile devices.
             </p>
             
             <h4>
               Research Question 4: Are the EFL students willing or ready to adopt the use of mobile assisted language learning devices in the classroom?
             </h4>
             
             <p>
               In Technology Acceptance Model,  <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3969/e582e68e418a2b79c604cd35d5d81de9b35d.pdf" target="_blank">Davis (1989)</a> believed that the two major factors of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are the most important and relevant determinants of actual system use. According to the data gathered from the survey, the students observed that there is a use for mobile devices in the classroom and that mobile devices would be easy to use for educational purposes since the majority of the students are familiar with different functions of mobile devices. In addition, the students believed that it would be easier to have access to the course materials and complete the class assignments if they could use their mobile devices outside of the classrooms. 
             </p>
             
             <p>
               The overall finding from the survey and the open-ended questions reveal that the students are more likely to adopt mobile devices in their classrooms. 
             </p>
             
             <p>
               Finally, if it has been argued in the literature that mobile devices motivate students to learn, then is there any evidence here that using the mobile-assisted language learning technology would help students to learn a language? The data from the survey show that the students typically did not use their smartphones or tablets for the purpose of language learning. However, it seems that the students were not aware that the mobile devices, beyond the internet use or the app installation, could help them to immerse themselves in a continuous practice context as they are on the move in their everyday lives.
