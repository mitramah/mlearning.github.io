			 After the students had filled out the demographic section of the survey, they were given seven questions about their prior knowledge and were asked to choose as many of the statements that applied to them.

             As it indicated except question 2, “ I know how to download an application(app) on a mobile device.” the majority of respondents were able to perform 6 out of 7 tasks. In addition, over 90% of the students were able to perform 5 out of 7 tasks (3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The lower rate for the statement 4 might be due to the fact that mobile devices are multi-functional. Users can listen to music on iTunes, add the song to their 'favorites' and download it if they wish. The other function is the RSS feed that can automatically send and update new information and different videos through YouTube. As a result, the users might not need to install/download different apps on their devices. This section also included the information about the students' ownership of mobile devices.
            </p>

             </figure>
             
             <p>
              The data shows that 25 out of 26 respondents owned a smartphone. The higher rate of smartphone ownership should be a reason for the school administrators to consider the incorporation of mobile devices into the current curriculum. 
             </p>
             <p>
              The next question of the survey asked the students to report on the prior use of mobile devices, and that they should check as many boxes as applied to them. The following table represents the number and percentage of the students who responded “yes” to the questions. 
             </p>

             <p>
             <figuercaption>

            </p>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
             The data indicates that the majority of the students (>50) were able to perform the tasks mentioned in this section. The highest response rates were appointed to the questions regarding socialization, and other functions on the device (questions 3, 6, and 15). However,  5 of the tasks concerning educational performance elicited a percentage rate of more than 80%. In addition, the data (0%) that was elicited from the question 10, “Have you ever accessed an Educational Management System (e.g. Moodle, VLC) on your mobile device?” reveals that the Virtual Linguistic Campus website (VLC) might need to be upgraded to adapt to the needs of the new generation of learners. 
            </p>
            <p>
             This section also asked students to report on the possible use of mobile-assisted language learning applications, e.g. Babble, or Doulingo. The following table represents the number of responses.
            </p>
            
             <figure>
                 <img src="img/language.png" alt="Students Language Application Use"  title="Students Language Application Use"/>

              Table 6: Students Language Application Use (N=26)
             </figuercaption>
            </p>
            </figure>
			
               <p>
                The data indicates that Babble and Duolingo applications are known to some students, and they have a response rate of greater than 15%.  It is also evident that the majority of the students who are studying to become English teachers are not aware of the benefits/challenges of incorporating technologies into their classrooms. The highest response rate (30.7%) belongs to the students who have never used a language learning application. 
               </p>
               <p>
                In the next section of the survey the participants were presented with the possibilities of various usage of mobile devices and how they could impact their participation and engagement inside or outside of the classroom. The responses were designed in Likert scales to record participants’ attitudes based on 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 4=Agree, and 5=Strongly Agree. The data was analyzed by calculating means and standard deviations for six statements respectively related to participation and engagement of the students. The table below contains the results of each question. As a result, means above 3 indicate the positive response in contrast to the means below 3 which indicate the negative response or attitude. 
               </p>
                
             <figure>
                 <img src="img/perception.png" alt="Perception of Participation"  title="Perception of Participation"/>
             <p>
             <figuercaption>
               Table 7: Students Perception of Participation &amp; Engagement (N=26)
             </figuercaption>
            </p>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
             The students showed positive attitudes towards the majority of the statements which means that participation and engagement would increase if students could use their mobile devices in the classrooms. 
            </p>
            <p>
             The students were asked to respond to questions that concern the use of mobile devices for educational purposes following the same 5-point Likert scale explained above. The means and standard deviations were calculated, and the results are represented in the table below.
            </p>
            
            <figure>
                 <img src="img/perception2.png" alt="Perception of Mobile Learning"  title="Perception of Mobile Learning"/>

            </p>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
             The data in this table indicated that students responded positively to the five statements. The highest means (questions 1, 2, and 4) were the statements also most agreed upon by the respondents, which are    indicated by the lower standard deviations. Despite the overall positive response, the higher standard deviations for questions 3, and 5 reveal that the students' opinions vary the most for these statements. 
            </p>
            <p>
             The next three questions asked the students to report on the amount of the effort it would require and how it would be easy to learn on their mobile device. The statements used the same 5-point Likert scale and the table below reports on the means and standard deviations for each question.
            </p>
            
             <figure>

            </p>
            </figure>
            
            <p>
             The questions about the ease of mobile use elicited a positive response from the students, yet the high standard deviations represented that students' opinions were decided equally among those who felt very comfortable with using their mobile devices in contrast to the other group.
            </p>
            
            <p>
             The results of a  'Yes/No' question is represented as a pie chart: 
            </p>
            
             <figure>
                 <img src="img/pie.png" alt="Role of Mobile Learning"  title="Role of Mobile Learning"/>
                 
             </figure>
             
             <p>
              In this question, the majority of respondents (>50%) believed that the mobile learning should have a significant role in the future of English language learning.
             </p>
             <p>
              The next question asked students to give their opinions about the biggest obstacles to the use of mobile learning in today's teaching.
             </p>
             
              <figure>
                 <img src="img/obstacle.png" alt="Obstcles to Mobile Learning"  title="Obstcles to Mobile Learning"/>
                 
             </figure>
             
             <p>
              The majority of the students (57.7%) believed that “school administration” is one of the biggest obstacles to the adoption of mobile learning. In addition, the students (42.3%) voted for “student attitudes” as another obstacle in the use of mobile learning in today's teaching.
