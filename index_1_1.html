			<p>While the rapid advancement in the features of mobile technology has helped the users to perform multiple tasks on a single device, the decrease in its cost has had both positive and adverse effects, particularly in connection to learning. The changes have happened so fast that the researchers have not had adequate time to observe and understand how these devices can be beneficial in education. While educators wait for the researchers to catch up and provide solutions, lack of research continues to create a bigger gap each day as technology continues to evolve and ownership continues to increase.</p>
            <p>
            A new study released by  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">ComScore</a> suggests that mobile devices have rapidly risen to become the leading digital platform. The report mentions that 60 percent of digital media time in the U.S. is spent on portable devices such as smartphones and tablets. The force behind mobile technology's constant growth, is mainly app usage, which alone makes up a majority of total digital media consumption at 52 percent. 
            </p>
			<p>Current research has not yet explored the potential of integrating mobile devices or mobile apps in a single classroom, nor has it explored the possibility of involving learners in mobile use for educational purposes inside and outside of the classroom. The gap in the research, combined with the concerns of educators who consider the mobile device as a distraction or an object for cheating, has led to policies that ban mobile devices in the classrooms. Educators do not necessarily agree much with the use of digital devices in the classrooms, but they are aware that these devices are not going away.</p>
			<p>According to a  <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center Study</a> released in April 2015, some 88 percent of American teens ages 13 to 17 have or have access to a mobile phone, and a majority of teens (73 percent) have smartphones. Ninety-two percent of teens report going online daily, with more than half saying theyâ€™re online several times a day. Twenty-four percent say they do so &ldquo;almost constantly.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Mobile devices are becoming more and more widespread in a variety of fields. Healthcare professionals now use smartphones or tablets for functions where they once used to need a pager, cell phone, and PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). Smartphones and tablets combine the features of communication and computing in a small portable device that allows easy access and use during the time of care <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4029126/" target="_blank">Ventola (2014).</a> Ventola's study (2014) indicates the pervasive use of mobile devices by medical professionals. They found that 90 percent of physicians use mobile devices in a wide variety of clinical settings ranging from classrooms to hospitals.

           <p>According to  <a href="http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/docs/P21_Framework_Definitions_New_Logo_2015.pdf" target="_blank">
           (Partnership for 21stCentury Skills, 2017)</a>, in today's 'media-driven environment' our students are called on to apply technology effectively through ICT (Information, Communication, and Technology) literacy. Practical application of ICT includes using technology as a tool to research, organize, evaluate and communicate information. Another application couls be the use of digital technologies (including mobile technology) to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, adapt and create information to successfully function in a global economy. For the students to succeed and acquire these necessary skills, it falls upon the educators to prepare them to navigate mobile devices as educational tools and engage them in important practice for their future careers.
           </p>
           
           <p> It is important to know that English language skills are also among the key subjects and 21st-century themes in the Partnership for 21st-century learning guideline. English language learners seem to be affected by the permanent presence of mobile devices in all the different areas of society. Language teachers should also embrace the changes, and grasp the potential usage of mobile devices for learning both inside and outside the classroom to prepare the students to succeed in their future careers. The history of mobile learning has been indiscriminate and incoherent with language and language learning not appearing in any given category, sector, country or modality <a href="http://www.jucs.org:8080/ujs/jucs/Journal/Volume%2021/Issue_21_10/mobile_technology_for_foreign/abstract.html;internal&action=buildframes.action&Parameter=1491583905068&ctx=eKS" target="_blank">(Traxler, Barcena, Laborda, 2015)</a>. The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of mobile assisted-language learning technologies on the students of English language learners, and how they would change the educational, sociocultural context.</p>
