			<p>The evolution of mobile learning, also known as M-learning, could be perceived as a revolutionary approach driven by versatile and constant use of mobile devices. Although the mobility of technology might seem the easy to grasp, the mobility of the learner and the mobility of societies as a whole, is the defining feature <a href="http://www.jucs.org:8080/ujs/jucs/Journal/Volume%2021/Issue_21_10/mobile_technology_for_foreign/abstract.html;internal&action=buildframes.action&Parameter=1491583905068&ctx=eKS" target="_blank">(Traxler, Barcena, Laborda, 2015)</a>. 'Mobile learning' is not just the conjunction of 'mobile' and 'learning'. It has always implicitly meant 'mobile E-Learning' and its history and development have to be understood as both a continuation of 'conventional' E-Learning and a reaction to this 'conventional' E-Learning and its perceived inadequacies and limitations  <a href="http://pakacademicsearch.com/pdf-files/com/319/93-100%20Volume%203,%20Issue%206,(Version%20III)%20June,%202013.pdf" target="_blank">(Mehdipour and Zerehkafi , 2013).</a> Over the past years, 'conventional' E-learning has been represented technologically by the emerging of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) and the change of state of CAL (computer assisted learning). Other salient changes are the growth of the learning object approach and an increase in 'multi-media interactivity, power, speed, functionality and bandwidth' <a href="http://www.jucs.org:8080/ujs/jucs/Journal/Volume%2021/Issue_21_10/mobile_technology_for_foreign/abstract.html;internal&action=buildframes.action&Parameter=1491583905068&ctx=eKS" target="_blank">(Traxler, Barcena, Laborda, 2015)</a>.</p>

            <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/42798542_Will_mobile_learning_change_language_learning" target="_blank">Kukulska-Hulme (2009)</a> argued that &quot;mobile learning is a tricky term as mobility refers to a mobility of technology, content, and learners in the context of learning.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
           This data indicates that mobile devices and the internet, as well as data services like SMS (Short Message Service) or MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), have little-known potential to advance the educational agendas through the use of mobile devices and Mobile learning that is also known as M-learning. The widespread usage of mobile devices means that the learners are ready to lead and engage in activities motivated by their personal needs and circumstances of use, including those emerging from greater mobility and travel  <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/8080/1/designed_and_usergenerated.pdf" target="_blank">(Kukulska-Hulme, Traxler &amp; Pettit, 2007; Pettit &amp; Kukulska-Hulme, 2007).</a></p>

           Some scholars defined M-learning, as a process of gaining knowledge through conversations across multiple contexts among people usage of interactive technologies with a focus on contexts <a href="https://telearn.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/190276/filename/Sharples_et_al_Theory_of_Mobile_Learning_preprint.pdf" target="_blank">(Sharples et al., 2007).</a> While, in the past, the focus of mobile learning was on the use of mobile technologies, in recent years, this perspective has changed to focus on the mobility of the learner. The emphasis has also been shifted to the informal aspects of M-learning.

            The technology that is called mobile in this process, involves any portable learning materials such as books, audio-cassettes, audio-CDs, and portable radios and DVD players, or any kinds of handheld mobile devices such as cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smartphones, pads, pods, etc. M-learning is identified both by being available &quot;<i>anytime, anywhere</i>&quot; that results in alteration of behavior, and the device that is used:

             	Mobile learning can perhaps be defined as any educational provision where the sole or dominant technologies are handheld or palmtop devices.  <a href="https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/ldc/resource/interactions/issues/issue25/traxler/" target="_blank">(Traxler 2005)</a> &rdquo; </i></blockquote>
             	
            <p>
             	Mobile learning is continually evolving, but the definition of mobile learning remains 'relatively vague and consensual, rather than precise and prescriptive'  <a href="http://www.jucs.org:8080/ujs/jucs/Journal/Volume%2021/Issue_21_10/mobile_technology_for_foreign/abstract.html;internal&action=buildframes.action&Parameter=1491583905068&ctx=eKS" target="_blank"> (Herrington et al. 09; Barcena et al. in press cited in Taxler et all 2015).</a> The revolutionary nature of Mobile learning has challenged recent theories of technology enhanced learning, inspired by the time when first the computer, then the networked computer were the dominant educational forms of digital technology. The mobile learning community has enhanced the concept and activity of learning beyond the earlier conceptions of learning  <a href="http://www.jucs.org:8080/ujs/jucs/Journal/Volume%2021/Issue_21_10/mobile_technology_for_foreign/abstract.html;internal&action=buildframes.action&Parameter=1491583905068&ctx=eKS" target="_blank"> (Herrington et al. 09; Barcena et al. in press cited in Taxler et all 2015).</a> The types of mobile learning activities include:    
            </p>
            
               <ul class="a">
                  <li>Contingent learning and teaching: Teachers and learners can respond in real time based on the changes in their environment and learning experiences.</li>
                  <li>Situated activities: Use of authentic activities to optimize learning.
                  </li> 
                  <li>Collaborative learning: learner-learner activities promote the learning process. Learners work on a shared task and the outcomes focus on their collective rather than individual efforts.   
                  </li>
                  <li>Informal and long-life learning: The use of mobile learning allow the learners to acquire knowledge anytime, anywhere. Informal and lifelong-learning learning activities beyond the classrooms  <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=mjOTDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PR23&ots=RV_LMHAUgV&dq=Transforming%20Education%20in%20the%20Gulf%20Region%3A%20Emerging%20Learning%20Technologies%20and%20Innovative%20Pedagogy%20for%20the%2021st%20Century&pg=PR23#v=onepage&q=Transforming%20Education%20in%20the%20Gulf%20Region:%20Emerging%20Learning%20Technologies%20and%20Innovative%20Pedagogy%20for%20the%2021st%20Century&f=false" target="_blank">(Alshahrani, Ally, 2016).</a>    
                  </li>
                  <li>Game-Based Learning: the mobile version of GBL.   
                  </li>
                  <li>Personalized learning: Learning is designed and customized based on the preferences and needs of the individual learners or group of learners.    
                  </li>
               </ul> 
               
            <p>
                The mobile learning community has also proven that they can disseminate knowledge to remote individuals, communities, and countries that previously cut off because of  depressed economic or social conditions and/or hard to reach by other external educational initiatives (Taxler, Barcena, Laborda, 2015).
