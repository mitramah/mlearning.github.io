			 Mobile assisted language learning (MALL) is defined as the formal or informal learning of a second language with the help of mobile devices.  <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24503/1/Chen%20X.pdf" target="_blank">Chen(2013)</a>  argues that despite the fact that users have been using portable devices for some time, MALL is a relatively new search area. The mobility of the MALL has been one of its primary distinguishing characteristics of traditional language learning, in addition to the possibilities of spatial and time shifts yielding increased
             learning opportunities <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/16987/" target="_blank">(Kukulska-Hulme, 2009). </a> That is to say, the accessibility of mobile devices offering 'personalized time' to the learners. It reduces the constraints of time and place provided by the formal learning, substituting more flexible informal learning opportunities <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24503/1/Chen%20X.pdf" target="_blank">Chen(2013)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			 Connectivity is another identifying feature of MALL. The current mobile devices are equipped with the inbuilt GPRS, Wi-Fi, and 3G Internet access features, providing the language learners with real context interactions which are lacking in the the more traditional forms of the language learning environment, especially in an informal out-of-class situation. Accordingly, language learners and language learning are no longer constricted to one-way individual learning but can diversify to two or multi-way collaborative learning <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24503/1/Chen%20X.pdf" target="_blank">(Lanet al., 2007; Chang &amp; Hsu, 2011 cited in Chen 2013).</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			 Portability is another feature that enables learners to move mobile devices and bring materials. The mobile devices can be taken to different places due to their small size and weight. This characteristic can be viewed as another opportunity for social interactivity, exchanging data and learner collaboration. Besides, context sensitivity, which refers to the data on the mobile devices, can be gathered to the current location and time  <a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1083417.pdf" target="_blank">(Bachore, 2015).</a>  
			</p>
			<p>
			 It is worth noticing that immediacy is another significant feature in MALL. As the technology of mobile devices is considered to be ubiquitous and can be available in most places, except remote areas, learners can connect and extend their learning opportunities immediately. Language practice on a mobile device could be seen as a stepping stone towards more authentic communication, through having to respond quickly “on the spot,” without the usual support available in the classroom or home  <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=T3xXHXAgmCYC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">(Demouy &amp; Kukulska-Hulme, 2010 cited in Díaz-Vera, 2012).</a> 
			</p>
			<p>
			 According to <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24503/1/Chen%20X.pdf" target="_blank">Chen(2013)</a> MALL may not only increase access to education, but it also promotes alternative learning processes and instructional methods. For instance, MALL has the potential to connect the gaps between formal and informal environments.

			 The topic of MALL studies using various mobile technologies has been miscellaneous. Studies with mobile phones have been focused on developing grammatical accuracy, learning vocabulary, improving speech fluency, student preferences and attitudes towards MALL. PDAs have been found effective in promoting intensive reading comprehension, creative learning of idioms, and in the acceptance of MALL <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24503/1/Chen%20X.pdf" target="_blank">Chen(2013)</a>. The majority of current MALL studies have centered in transforming former classroom or computer-based contents onto the mobile platform, such as using mobile devices as a tool to deliver materials previously used with paper or computer-based media, or developing 'trans-platform' applications like mobile dictionaries, quizzes, or survey tools<a href="http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24503/1/Chen%20X.pdf" target="_blank">Chen(2013)</a>. As a pedagogical standpoint, one of MALL's greatest challenges with mobile learning is to ensure that the tasks are suited to the affordability of the devices used. The phenomenon of trans-platform applications existed in the early research into CALL. What we are tending to see with mobile devices is that many activities merely follow the steps of their predecessors, and they seem to fall into the same 'trap' of what came beforehand <a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1083417.pdf" target="_blank">(Bachore, 2015).</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
             In these studies, mobile devices are considered as a new means for content delivery, rather than as tools used to facilitate new learning. The collaborative and communicative affordances of mobility and connectivity have not been fully exploited  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/42795774_An_Overview_of_Mobile_Assisted_Language_Learning_From_Content_Delivery_to_Supported_Collaboration_and_Interaction" target="_blank">(Kukulska-Hulme &amp; Shield, 2008).</a> It is, therefore, necessary that MALL scholars “move beyond a superficial understanding of the field and focus more on how mobility, accompanied by digital, location-aware technologies, changes learning” <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/16987/" target="_blank">(Kukulska-Hulme, 2009).</a> To achieve this goal, there is a need to investigate how mobile tools are used by the learners in the process of learning. To get a better indication of the nature of mobile learning it is better to view its application in "naturalistic settings" where the nature of mobile technology is thoroughly understood , and how learners perceive mobile devices as tools that promote language learning <a href="http://llt.msu.edu/vol14num2/stockwell.pdf" target="_blank">(Stockwell, 2010)</a> . Unfortunately, as  <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/8134/1/356-3034-1-PB.pdf" target="_blank">Kukulska-Hulme (2007)</a>  argues, many of the mobile devices available to the learners are simply not designed or developed for educational purposes, causing difficulty in pursuing the activities expected by the teachers. It is, therefore, important for teachers to not only fully understand the role MALL plays in the language learning process, but it also necessary to be aware of the types of the tools learners possess, and to chose and adapted resources to suit these tools <a href="http://llt.msu.edu/vol14num2/stockwell.pdf" target="_blank">(Stockwell, 2010).</a>
